<p>Yes, either socks or tights depending on the style of dance or your personal preference. I absolutely hate having tights inside of my slippers but my studio requires tights (and i prefer to dance in tights) so i always wear footless or convertibles (when i have pointe), and i prefer to wear tights with my jazz shoes (capezio freedoms) but i really dislike the feeling of tights inside of my ballet slippers. These are also the most comfortable for children with sensitive toes. Do be gentle when putting your footwear on and taking it off.</p>
