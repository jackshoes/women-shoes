It is not uncommon to size up in cycling shoes. They have a us$25 restocking fee for each return, so it added an extra us$50 plus shipping charges to get the right size. This size guide is for reference and for best fit.</p>
<h3 id="the-longest-measure-is-the-size-to-use">The Longest Measure Is The Size To Use.</h3><p>Trial and error fitting may be necessary for proper comfort. Claimed weight for a size 42 shoe is 220g per shoe but our size 43 sample weighs 267g on the bikeradar. So, for example, i generally wear a 10.5 or 11 in everyday shoes, but i wear a 43.5 in road cycling shoes. However, if you’re between two shoe sizes, for example, one time you get shoes in size 9 and the other 9.5, don’t size up on cycling shoes as they should feel snug around your feet.</p>
