<p>$126.99 , price per month: These shoes were very cute but very loose in the ankle, making them wildly. I don't have any sandals, but the shoes i have (3 pairs maybe?) are very comfortable. I usually wear an 8 in boots (because i like to have extra room for my bunion and a 3/4 rigid insole) but i have them in 7.5 and they are plenty roomy even with aforementioned insole inside and thick socks.

<p>I didn’t want to size up, so i used my shoe stretcher on the right one. 1 found this review helpful. I was disappointed but i know that even in some other shoes i've had to buy a 9.5. From my experience and reading other customer reviews, many miz mooz styles run a half size small. Pin by Victoria Wagner on Fabulous Shoes! Miz mooz shoes.</p>

<p>I've found that miz mooz always run small, so i ordered these in 11w instead of my usual 9.5 or 10w and the fit was comfortable. I have a bunion on one foot so was wary of that, but with very light socks (very light), i think these will be fine. My miz mooz lace up boots (the style is margaux, but i think they are no longer available) run a little big. Otherwise the 38 was a perfect fit for my 7.5 shoe size.
