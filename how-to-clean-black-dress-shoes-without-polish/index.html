If you must get your boots a little wet to clean them off, allow them time to dry before applying the polish. Place your insole on top of a newspaper and apply mild detergent, or facial cleanser on the leather to lift away stubborn stains and odor (use a damp cloth moistened with lukewarm or cold water) don&#39;t rinse out and pat dry with a soft cloth If your new shoes have leather soles, every time you polish them, take ten seconds to apply a couple of brush strokes to the instep part of the soles, this area is vulnerable to splashing, and the carnauba wax in the polish helps to protect the leather from the damaging effect of water. Use a clean, damp rag to clean off any dust from the shoe and then buff with a small drop of oil to bring out the shine.
